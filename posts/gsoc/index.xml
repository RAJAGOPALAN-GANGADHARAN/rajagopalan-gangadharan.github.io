This is me Rajagopalan working on getting webkit2 on haiku. Previously as you guys know we were trying to get IPC working. Well we have succeeded in that after hitting some obstacles.
Message passing should not involve mainloop it should be totally dependent on the workqueue only. As the mainloop can be blocked because of JS Execution which leaves slow performance or even crash. Also we stumbled upon an IPC deadlock when we used mainloop (main application loop) as a proxy to send and receive messages.</description></item><item><title>Mid Community Bonding-- Gsoc</title><link>https://rajagopalan-gangadharan.github.io/posts/gsoc/mid-com/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 23:31:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajagopalan-gangadharan.github.io/posts/gsoc/mid-com/</guid><description>Introduction: Hello Everybody, I am G.Rajagopalan working on porting webkit2 to haiku as a part of my GSoC project. So here I am to share our experiences and work regarding the project üòÑ.
Bonding Process: I have been with haiku for the past 6 (or 7 months I think) which went like a blink of an eye. I can definitely say that it is a memorable journey with Haiku. I owe it to the beautiful and friendly people who work for haiku.</description></item><item><title>Coding week no 2 and 3 - Gsoc</title><link>https://rajagopalan-gangadharan.github.io/posts/gsoc/cw2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2019 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://rajagopalan-gangadharan.github.io/posts/gsoc/cw2/</guid><description>Report for Coding Week #2 and #3 Love that your beautiful face is reading my Blog today‚ù§Ô∏è.
